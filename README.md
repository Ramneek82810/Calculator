# 🧮 GUI Calculator using Python

A simple yet powerful GUI calculator built with Python's Tkinter library. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and offers an intuitive interface for quick calculations. Ideal for beginners to learn GUI development in Python and event-driven programming.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division  
- 🖱️ Button-based interaction with real-time expression building  
- 🔄 Clear button to reset the entire input field  
- 🧠 Uses `eval()` for evaluating expressions  
- 🔢 Display panel updates dynamically as the user inputs values  
- 💡 Minimal and clean user interface using Tkinter  
- 🪶 Lightweight – no external libraries required  

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── calculator.py           # Main application file containing GUI code and logic
└── README.md               # You're reading it!
```

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Ramneek82810/Calculator.git
cd Calculator
```

### 2. Run the Application

```
python calculator.py
```

## 💡 How It Works

- Uses `tkinter.Tk()` to launch a GUI window  
- Buttons are placed using grid layout for a calculator-like look  
- Button click events are bound to update the input field  
- The `eval()` function is used to compute the entered arithmetic expression  
- Handles invalid operations with basic error handling  

## 📌 Todo / Future Enhancements

- ⌨️ Keyboard support for direct typing  
- 🧮 Add scientific operations: square root, exponent, logarithm, etc.  
- 🌙 Dark/light theme toggle  
- 🧾 Calculation history  
- 🧪 Unit tests for calculator logic (for CLI/testing mode)  
- 🌐 Web version using Streamlit or Flask  

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project helps beginners understand:

- Event-driven programming in Python  
- GUI development using Tkinter  
- Grid layouts and widget bindings  
- Basic error handling  
- Application structuring for small tools
